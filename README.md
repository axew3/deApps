Store as encrypted or send messages online so that they can only be read/seen by people who own the keys.
There's no way to circumvent this because the HTML/Javascript code doesn't send any information to the server;
the server is the browser in this case.
The HTML file can be used either online (perhaps using Firefox! in private mode so that when you close the browser, after encrypting or decrypting a message, no one will know you even did it, because nothing is sent to the server, remember that what is processed remains entirely on the browser stack).
Or also, you can download the HTML file and run it on your smartphone or PC without loading it from the website,
but only from the device's filesystem with the browser (always use Firefox please :) ). 
The code encrypts the text with a 4096-bit RSA encryption that's impossible to decipher:
a well-equipped quantum PC is estimated to take 45 years to find the key. Do you have a quantum PC right now?
Want you to be truly sure no one can read your archived or sent messages? This is the only real way. Enjoy!
